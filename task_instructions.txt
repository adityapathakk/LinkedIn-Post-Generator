# AI Freelance: SLM-Enhanced LinkedIn Post Generator

## Objective
Design a system that:
Accepts a short idea for a LinkedIn post
Uses a custom-built Small Language Model (SLM) to:
Refine the prompt before passing to an LLM
OR clean/polish/structure the output after generation
Uses an open-source LLM for actual content generation

(Bonus) Auto-extracts persona from previous LinkedIn posts to match tone/style

## Task Overview
### Input:
A short description of what user wants to post:
 e.g., "Gave a talk at a college about branding"
(Optional but bonus): 3‚Äì5 previous LinkedIn posts (text format)

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Flow:
[Raw User Input]
      ‚Üì
 [SLM] ‚Üí Refines the prompt (adds tone, voice, structure hints)
      ‚Üì
 [Open-source LLM] ‚Üí Generates human-like post
      ‚Üì
 [SLM] ‚Üí Optionally reworks the output: trims fluff, adds emoji, ensures tone
      ‚Üì
[Final LinkedIn-Ready Post]

### üî® SLM Requirements:
You must develop or fine-tune a custom small model (under 100M parameters preferred) that can:
Either:
Preprocess the prompt: add voice markers, formatting cues, inferred tone
 OR
Postprocess the LLM output: polish structure, fix tone mismatches, trim verbosity
Should run locally or via HuggingFace inference

### Tools allowed:
DistilBERT, TinyLlama, MiniLM, ALBERT, BERT2BERT, etc.
Optional: train a small seq2seq or transformer-based model on synthetic data

### Output:
A LinkedIn-style humanized post according to user persona post (150‚Äì300 words)
Clear paragraph structure, clean grammar
Emotionally resonant, real human tone
Mimics the user‚Äôs past tone if posts are provided

### Bonus Features (Optional but Impressive):
Feature
Persona extraction from past posts
Prompt templates based on profession (e.g., designer, coach)
Postprocessor SLM for trimming/correcting LLM output
Minimal UI to demo flow

## Time Limit: Forms will be open till 26th May 2025 11:59 PM

## Deliverables:
### Python code (well-documented) for:
The SLM architecture (training or inference)
Integration with the LLM

### A README.md explaining:
Architecture design
SLM's logic and role
Any training datasets used (can be synthetic)

### At least 3 test cases showing:
Raw input ‚Üí SLM ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Output
With and without persona input
